2. **Assistance** 

Each team member can be contacted through text messaging or email. We commit to responding within 24 hours. 

3. **Respect** 

When sharing ideas, we will make sure every team member is heard, and work to compromise if necessary. All team members promise to be present and engaged in team discussions and meetings. Our meetings and discussions are a safe space for collaboration, this is a bully free zone. :)

## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 

For the beginning of the project, we will start out by meeting in person or through Zoom, to make sure everyone is on the same page and the set up of the project goes smoothly. Then, we can split work by algorithms if meeting is not possible. The development log will be worked on by all of us through a shared document. If an unforeseen circumstance occurs, then we will all call a meeting to discuss our next course of action. 

5. **Time Commitment** 

To ensure equal distribution of work, we will each spend 2 hours outside the 2 hour meeting time to work on our respective parts every week. We have set up a meeting time every week when everyone is available so there are no other commitments that need to be accounted for, everyone will have till the next meeting to work on their part of the project on their own time. Conflicts will be addressed by discussing the problem with the whole group or approaching the mentor. 

6. **Conflict Resolution** 

All conflicts within the team will be decided through a group discussion that will include our project mentor if necessary. Any issues that may be best decided by majority rule may be done through vote.
